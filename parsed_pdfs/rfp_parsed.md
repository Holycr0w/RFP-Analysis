# ANNEXURE

## About Aani

Aani is a new payments experience that is delivered to everyone in the UAE by the licensed financial institutions (LFIs) and Al Etihad Payments (AEP).

1. Aani simplifies the payment process by allowing instant fund transfers using just only the recipient's mobile number, email or a QR code, thus eliminating the need to ask for or remember complex IBANs.

2. What's great is the speed in processing transactions that happen in a matter seconds (less than 10 seconds) and we can instantly see the transaction either succeeding or failing status.

Aani is available via all participating financial institutions apps, so to send money, users can open their financial institution's app mobile app, select a payee from their phone book, authenticate and send money creating a relatively easy customer experience. Additionally, through the central Aani app, available on the App Store, Google Play and Huawei Store users can connect multiple accounts from various financial institutions and transact with Aani from one place.

Among other features Aani offers:

- Request Money - allowing users to effortlessly request funds from contacts or pay for your purchase in physical stores or online.

- QR codes at point of sale - Merchants who may not be able to accept card payments can now display a QR code, which can be scanned with the customer's banking app or the Aani app and the merchant receives money in real time.

## About Jaywan

Jaywan is the UAE's Domestic Card Scheme, designed to provide a localized and enhanced card payment experience. It supports the UAE's digital payments strategy by catering to the unique needs of the local population and advancing the nation's payment infrastructure globally. Through phased implementation, Jaywan aims to establish a robust ecosystem of UAE-branded cards accepted across multiple channels, including ATMs, POS terminals, and e-commerce platforms.

"Jaywan" is an Emirati Arabic word that means precious pearl. Pearls have a close association with the culture and heritage of the United Arab Emirates and represent an integral part of the UAE's living history. They hold a special place in the hearts of Emiratis, characterized by their rarity, high value, and a distinctive white colour with a subtle hint of red. Pearl diving also anchored the economy, as pearl diving money circulated in the market and allowed communities to benefit. The pearl diving ecosystem also reveals how the UAE's internationalisation began much before the discovery of oil, and helped shaped the country's huge ambitions.
